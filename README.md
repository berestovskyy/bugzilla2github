ABOUT
=====
This is a tool to convert Bugzilla bug reports to GitHub Issue Tracker
using Bugzilla XML export and GitHub REST API v3:<br/>
https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/

Converts Bugzilla emails to Github accounts, statuses to states,
Bugzilla components, priorities, severities, resolutions to GitHub labels.

Latest updates:

* 2018-12-22 -- added support for GitHub beta import API
  (activate with `-b` command line option)
* 2018-06-20 -- new better algorithm to post new and deleted bugs
* 2018-06-15 -- added support for deleted bugs (see below)


Notes on GitHub beta import API
-------------------------------
Thanks to Th√©o Zimmermann and Martin Michlmayr, bugzilla2github now supports
GitHub beta import API. Advantages of the new API:

* should import faster;
* does not trigger notifications for users;
* has a better support for bug comments.

The results of the beta API run is available here:
https://github.com/berestovskyy/bugzilla2github-demo-beta/issues

Note that beta API does not support issue update, so bugzilla2github falls back
to stable API in case of script interrupt.

MANAGING CONFLICTS
------------------
The script deals with existing GitHub issues by renumbering Bugzilla
bug IDs.

Say, if there are already reported issues #1-10 on GitHub and there
are bugs #1-100 in Bugzilla. The script will leave untouched GitHub
issues #1-10, converts Bugzilla bugs #11-100 to GitHub issues #11-100
and then converts Bugzilla bugs #1-10 to GitHub issues #101-110.

At the end, for GitHub issues #1-10 script will add a comment, that
Bugzilla bugs #1-10 were renumbered to #101-110.


DELETED BUGS
------------
Github Issues Tracker allows assigning consecutive IDs only.
So bugzilla2github creates dummy issues in place of a deleted original
Bugzilla bugs.

Say, if there are bugs #1-10 in Bugzilla, then #20-30. The script will
import bugs #1-10 from Bugzilla, then will create dummy bug reports
to fill the IDs #11-19, and at the end will add the rest of Bugzilla
bugs #20-30.



QUICK START
===========
 1. Export Bugzilla issues into an XML file:
    - in Bugzilla select "Search"
    - select all statuses
    - at the very end click an XML icon
    - save the XML into a file

 2. Generate a GitHub access token:
    - on GitHub in top-right corner click on your avatar and then select "Settings"
    - in settings select "Developer settings"
    - select "Personal access tokens"
    - click "Generate new token"
    - type a token description, i.e. "bugzilla2github"
    - select "public_repo" to access just public repositories
    - save the generated token

 3. Dry-run the migration script and check all the warnings.
    **NOTE: Script dry-runs by default. No changes are posted to GitHub.**

    $ bugzilla2github -x export.xml -o GITHUB_OWNER -r GITHUB_REPO -t token

<pre>
    Where:
      -x  source XML file (exported from Bugzilla)
      -o  destination GitHub owner
      -r  destination GitHub repo
      -t  generated GitHub access token
</pre>

 4. Run the migration script again and force the updates adding `-f`:

    $ bugzilla2github -x export.xml -o GITHUB_OWNER -r GITHUB_REPO -t token -f

<pre>
    Where:
      -x  source XML file (exported from Bugzilla)
      -o  destination GitHub owner
      -r  destination GitHub repo
      -t  generated GitHub access token
      -f  force updates (i.e. post changes to GitHub)
</pre>
